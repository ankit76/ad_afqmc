# Architecture Overview

## AFQMC background

Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) computes low-lying electronic states
by stochastically propagating a population of **walkers** (Slater
determinants) in imaginary time. At each time step a **propagator** applies a
Trotter-decomposed exponential of the Hamiltonian, using random **auxiliary
fields** sampled via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. A **trial
wave function** supplies the quantities needed for importance
sampling and the phaseless constraint that controls the sign problem.
**Measurements** (energy, density matrices, etc.) are taken as mixed estimators
between the walkers and the trial at the end of each block of propagation
steps. See [Motta and Zhang, 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02242) for a comprehensive review
of _ab initio_ AFQMC. The code in this package is based on JAX, enabling end-to-end
automatic differentiation, JIT compilation, vectorization, and GPU acceleration.

```

**Staging** (`staging.py`) takes a PySCF mean field or coupled cluster object
and produces `StagedInputs`: the Cholesky decomposed Hamiltonian (`HamInput`)
and trial wave function data (`TrialInput`), with optional HDF5 caching.

**Job assembly** (`setup.py`) converts `StagedInputs` into JAX arrays,
selects the appropriate `trial_ops` / `meas_ops` /
`prop_ops`, and bundles everything into a `Job`.

**QMC execution** (`driver.py`) runs the equilibration and sampling loops,
calling the JIT compiled `block` function with `jax.lax.scan`.

The runtime and direct drivers pass the already built measurement context
to `PropOps.init_prop_state` through its optional `meas_ctx` keyword. State
initialization reuses this context for the initial energy instead of building
a second copy. Standalone initialization can omit `meas_ctx` and build it as
needed. Custom initializers should accept this keyword as part of the
`InitPropState` protocol.

The standard AFQMC initializer uses an optional `MeasOps.kernels["energy_init"]`
implementation when provided, falling back to `"energy"`. This must compute
the same deterministic local energy; it can trade speed for lower workspace
in this one-time calculation. CISD modes use Cholesky batching here, while
their regular `"energy"` kernel retains the full-Cholesky contractions.

For a Hamiltonian sharded along the first Cholesky axis (`P("model")`),
the setup builders detect the concrete input mesh before JIT tracing. The
Cholesky-square sum and CISD-mode setup use `jax.shard_map` so their batches
index each device's local vectors. The square sum reduces an orbital matrix;
`lci1` and reference scores remain distributed; the initial energy reduces
residual scalar contributions and adds the global base once. The CISD-mode
context stores this setup mesh as static metadata. Direct calls to compiled
`_sum_chol_squares` and `_build_lci1` must supply `mesh` explicitly to select
this path. Single-device setup retains the original 256-vector batching.

### When to use which container

Objects that flow through JAX transformations (`jit`, `lax.scan`, `vmap`) as
dynamic values must be **JAX pytrees** so their array leaves can be traced.

- **`NamedTuple` (as pytree)** — automatically a pytree with all fields as
  children. Good when every field is a JAX array and no validation or
  defaults are needed. Used for `PropState` (threaded through `lax.scan`
  each step).
- **`NamedTuple` (as record)** — also useful as a lightweight immutable
  record even when pytree behaviour is not needed, as long as you don't
  need methods or `default_factory`. Used for `TrialOps` (a simple bag of
  callables with `None` defaults, captured in JIT closures).
- **`@dataclass(frozen=True)` + manual pytree registration** — needed when
  some fields are static metadata (strings, ints) that belong in `aux_data`
  rather than traced children, or when you want `__post_init__` validation
  or non-trailing defaults. Used for `HamChol`, `meas_ctx`, and `prop_ctx`.
- **Plain `@dataclass(frozen=True)` (not a pytree)** — for objects that are
  never traced: static configuration captured in JIT closures or passed via
  `static_argnames`. Preferred over `NamedTuple` when you need methods or
  `field(default_factory=...)`. Used for `QmcParams`, `System`, `MeasOps`
  (which has helper methods like `require_kernel()`), and `PropOps`.

Note that large objects like the Hamiltonian should not be closed over in JIT
closures as they can lead to excessive compilation time and memory usage.

## Walker and Hamiltonian representations

`walkers.vmap_chunked` interprets `n_chunks` per data shard. With 400 walkers
on a `(data, model)=(4,1)` mesh, four chunks process 25 walkers at a time on
each device. For `n_chunks > 1`, a `shard_map` makes only the data axis
manual, placing the chunk loop inside the local walker population while
leaving model-axis contractions to automatic partitioning. The unchunked
`vmap` path is unchanged. The automatic memory selector caps its search at
the local population size and reports `walkers_per_data_shard`.

The helper reads the mesh from the mapped argument's abstract type, which
retains Auto mesh axes inside JIT tracing even when the concrete partition
spec is unavailable. Walker mappings use axis zero for data. Calls that map
shared Cholesky indices or sampled pair indices explicitly set
`shard_walkers=False` to retain their original generic chunking. A surrounding
manual data map already supplies local walkers and does not need another
data map; small reference populations not divisible by the data mesh also
retain generic chunking.

The `WalkerKind` literal (`"restricted"`, `"unrestricted"`, `"generalized"`)
determines how walker Slater determinants are stored. All walker arrays are complex
in _ab_initio_ AFQMC.
Cholesky Hamiltonian also follows the same basis conventions. Measurement function names
like force bias and energy indicate the walker and Hamiltonian kinds with suffixes, e.g., `_uw_rh` for
unrestricted walkers and restricted Hamiltonians.

### Restricted

Used for R(O)HF like walkers. A single coefficient matrix represents
both spins:

```
walkers: (n_walkers, norb, n_occ)
```

where n_occ = max(nup, ndn). Most commonly used.

### Unrestricted

Separate matrices for each spin:

```
walkers: (w_alpha, w_beta)
  w_alpha: (n_walkers, norb, nup)
  w_beta:  (n_walkers, norb, ndn)
```

### Generalized

Used with GHF basis Hamiltonians. A single matrix over spin-orbitals:

```
walkers: (n_walkers, 2*norb, ne)      where ne = nup + ndn
```

Every trial type (RHF, UHF, CISD, ...) implements overlap functions for all
three walker kinds, so walker kind and trial kind can be mixed freely. Currently
the code supports `"restricted"` Hamiltonians in most cases and we are adding support for
other kinds.

## Module summaries

### `ham/` -- Hamiltonian

Stores the molecular Hamiltonian in Cholesky decomposed form. `HamChol` holds
the scalar energy `h0`, one body integrals `h1`, and Cholesky vectors `chol`.
`HamChol` is a JAX pytree so it flows through `jit` and `lax.scan` without special handling.
The module also provides `hubbard.py` for lattice model Hamiltonians.

### `trial/` -- Trial Wave functions

Each module defines a frozen dataclass for trial data (e.g. `RhfTrial`,
`CisdTrial`, `UcisdTrial`), trial related functions like overlap, and a
factory `make_<kind>_trial_ops(sys)` that returns a `TrialOps` bundle with
the correct overlap function for the current walker type. Supported trial
types: RHF, UHF, GHF, CISD, UCISD, GCISD, CIS, EOM-CISD, and multi-GHF.

`auto.py` is useful for prototyping and testing: it only requires the definition
of the overlap and other quantities like force bias and energy are calculated by
taking derivatives.

### `meas/` -- Measurements

Mirrors `trial/` one to one, and defines measurement operations for each trial type.
Each module provides `make_<kind>_meas_ops(sys)` factory returning a `MeasOps` with required
algorithm kernels (`"energy"`, `"force_bias"`) and optional observable kernels (`"rdm1"`,
`"density_corr"`, etc.). Measurement contexts (`meas_ctx`) contain intermediates
evaluated once at the beginning of the calculations, like half-rotated integrals,
that allow for efficient estimator evaluation.

### `prop/` -- Propagation

Drives the imaginary time evolution. `types.py` defines `QmcParams`,
`PropState`, and `PropOps`. `afqmc.py` implements the standard phaseless
AFQMC step (auxiliary field sampling, Trotter propagation, importance sampling and constraint,
population control). `chol_afqmc_ops.py` contains low-level
Cholesky specific operations (Trotter exponentials, mean field shifts).
`blocks.py` packages a full block of propagation steps plus walker
orthogonalisation, measurement, and stochastic reconfiguration.

`cpmc.py` implements constrained path Monte Carlo as an alternative
propagation method for Hubbard models.

### `core/` -- Core Types

Defines the basic types: `System` and `WalkerKind` (`system.py`),
operation protocols `TrialOps` / `MeasOps` / `HamOps` (`ops.py`), type aliases
(`typing.py`), and MLMC level specifications `LevelSpec` / `LevelPack`
(`levels.py`).

---

## Entry points

The package offers three levels of API, from highest to lowest:

### 1. `AFQMC` class (high-level)

Defined in `afqmc.py`. Accepts a PySCF mean field or coupled cluster object
and handles staging, job assembly, and execution internally:

```python
from trot import AFQMC

afqmc = AFQMC(mf, norb_frozen=1, n_walkers=200, n_blocks=200)
mean, err = afqmc.kernel()
```

Key attributes: `walker_kind`, `mixed_precision`, `staged`, `job`, `e_tot`,
`e_err`.

#### Retained-mode CISD/UCISD trials

The opt-in CISD workflow is configured as one nested object rather than a
collection of flags on `AFQMC`. Mode compression is a host-side trial
preparation step; walker--Cholesky pair sampling is a runtime measurement
policy tuned after equilibration:

```python
from trot.afqmc import Afqmc
from trot.cisd_workflow import CisdWorkflowConfig

workflow = CisdWorkflowConfig.pair_sampled(
    discarded_norm_target=0.1,
    solver="auto",
)
afqmc = Afqmc(
    mycc,
    cache="afqmc.h5",
    cisd_workflow=workflow,
    n_walkers=200,
    n_eql_blocks=50,
    n_blocks=1000,
)

# Prefer doing this directly after the PySCF CC calculation on its CPU node.
# The raw amplitudes remain in trial/data; the smaller derived modes are cached
# alongside them below trial/derived.
afqmc.prepare_cisd_trial_cache()
```

With `solver="auto"`, host preparation uses dense diagonalization only when
both its estimated peak memory and the LAPACK workspace-index range are safe.
For an inexact mode selection, a dense `MemoryError` is retried with the
matrix-free Lanczos solver.

The GPU job can then load only the selected derived representation:

```python
afqmc = Afqmc.from_staged("afqmc.h5", cisd_workflow=workflow)
afqmc.walker_kind = "restricted"
energy, error = afqmc.kernel(target_error=2.0e-4)
```

Keeping the raw amplitudes makes a later change in compression policy
reproducible without rerunning CC. Derived representations are keyed by the
complete `CisdModeConfig`, so several cutoffs can coexist in one staged file.
If no matching cached representation exists, `setup()` can still construct it
from the raw amplitudes, but doing so during the GPU job is usually less
convenient.

### 2. `setup()` function (mid-level)

Defined in `setup.py`. Builds a `Job` from a PySCF object, `StagedInputs`, or
an HDF5 cache path, with full control over walker kind, precision, QMC
parameters, and custom operation overrides:

```python
from trot.setup import setup

job = setup(mf, walker_kind="restricted", mixed_precision=False)
mean, err, block_e, block_w = job.kernel()
```

### 3. `run_qmc()` / `run_qmc_energy()` (low-level)

Defined in `driver.py`. Operates directly on prebuilt components. Useful
when you need to supply a custom `PropState`, swap out individual operation
bundles, request specific observables, or resume a run:

```python
from trot.driver import run_qmc

result = run_qmc(
    sys=sys,
    params=params,
    ham_data=ham_data,
    trial_data=trial_data,
    trial_ops=trial_ops,
    meas_ops=meas_ops,
    prop_ops=prop_ops,
    block_fn=block_fn,
    observable_names=("rdm1",),
)
```

`run_qmc` returns a `QmcResult` namedtuple with `mean_energy`,
`stderr_energy`, `block_energies`, `block_weights`, `block_observables`, and
`observable_means`. The convenience wrapper `run_qmc_energy` returns only
`(mean, stderr, block_energies, block_weights)`.
